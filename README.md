# Swift file handling utilities.

This package supplies two libraries:

## Files

Miscellaneous FileManager and URL extensions.

A File/Folder abstraction.

The abstraction in similar to [this one by John Sundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files), but makes a few different decisions.

It's not as complete yet as that one - I'm just adding things as I need them.


## FilesKit

This adds desktop/shell support built on top of the basic Files library.

It requires AppKit/UIKit (depending on the platform you build it for), which is why it's a separate library.
